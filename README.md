# Dspfinal -> Robotify

The goal of this project is to create a real-time filter using python [Tkinter, GUI] to simulate the sound of the robot.

### Functionality

1. The sound after filtering will be played back to the speaker immediately & a copy of the sound will be stored in the file.

2. User could adjust the frequency of the sound to change the tone of the sound by using the GUI interface provided.

3. A real-time sound graph will be provided to make the project looks cooler.

4. Greeting voice(i guess?) - "Welcome to the world of tmr!"
